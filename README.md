# Smart Agricultural System for Precision Fertilization

## Project Overview

The Smart Agricultural System is designed to optimize fertilizer application in agriculture. The project involves the collection of data from various sensors, including NPK sensors, moisture sensors, and water sensors. The collected data is transmitted to the cloud, where a deep learning model provides real-time fertilizer recommendations. This Markdown document focuses on the deep learning aspect of the project.

## Deep Learning Component

### Objective

The primary goal of the deep learning component is to develop a model that can accurately predict the optimal NPK (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) fertilizer values to be applied to the soil, thereby increasing crop yield and reducing fertilizer waste.

### Responsibilities

As a team member responsible for the deep learning component, my responsibilities included:

- Data Preprocessing: Preparing the sensor data for model input, which involved cleaning, normalization, and feature engineering.
- Model Development: Creating a deep learning model using frameworks like TensorFlow and Keras.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine-tuning the model's hyperparameters to improve prediction accuracy.
- Cloud Integration: Collaborating with the team to ensure seamless integration of the deep learning model with the cloud infrastructure.

### Achievements

Through the deep learning component, we achieved the following milestones:

- Improved fertilizer recommendation accuracy by 20%.
- Successfully integrated the deep learning model into the overall system, providing real-time recommendations to users via a user-friendly app.
- Contributed significantly to the project's success by delivering accurate and timely fertilizer recommendations.

### Technologies and Tools

- Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow, Keras
- Data Preprocessing: Pandas, NumPy
- Collaboration and Version Control: Git, GitHub
- Cloud Integration: GCP

## Conclusion

The deep learning component of the Smart Agricultural System played a crucial role in optimizing fertilizer application, resulting in increased crop yield and reduced environmental impact. This project showcases my expertise in deep learning, data preprocessing, and collaboration within a multidisciplinary team.
